        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>
            Welcome, I am Rony, I like creating awesome software. I am currently an engine 
            programmer at Digital Confectioners. I earned a bachelor's degree in 
            Software Engineering from Media Design School in Auckland New Zealand. 
            I have significant experience in game development with particular interest 
            in gameplay and engine programming. You can view a few of my personal and group <a href="#projects">projects</a> here. 
            Feel free to <a href="#contact">get in touch</a>, I'd be happy to chat about job opportunities and projects I've 
            worked on.
        </p>

                <p>Titan Voyager is a first-person shooter game written in C++ and modern OpenGL (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsNVl4pKtI4" target="_blank">watch gameplay footage here</a>). The game takes place on a 
                mysterious Saturnian moon where the player has to retrieve some important data while also fighting 
                enemies. This project captured a lot of interest on reddit and was discussed <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/9g4blt/showing_my_fps_game_written_in_c_and_opengl/" target="_blank">here</a>. </p>

                player has to guide a slime up a series of platforms without falling or colliding with an enemy. The 
                enemies are accompanied with a growling sound and can be killed by the player. </p>
