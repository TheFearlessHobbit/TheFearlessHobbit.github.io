        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>
            I am Rony, I like creating awesome software. I am currently an engine 
            programmer at Digital Confectioners. I earned a bachelor's degree in 
            Software Engineering from Media Design School in Auckland New Zealand. 
            I have significant experience in game development with particular interest 
            in gameplay and engine programming. You can view a few of my personal projects here 
            and check out some fun stuff I do in my free time. Feel free to get in touch, I'd 
            be happy to chat about job opportunities, projects I've worked on, or whatever is on 
            your mind.

                mysterious Saturnian moon where the player has to retrieve some important data while also fighting 
                enemies. This project captured a lot of interest on reddit and was discussed <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/9g4blt/showing_my_fps_game_written_in_c_and_opengl/" target="_blank">here</a>. </p>

                    joints, and three different birds with different mechanics.</p>
