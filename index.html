        <p>
            Welcome, I'm Rony Hanna, I like creating video games. I have significant experience in game development with particular interest in graphics programming. I'm currently a full time Unity Developer at Kai's Clan in Auckland working on a multiplayer educational game. Previously I worked as a full time Junior Engine Developer at Digital Confectioners in Christchurch. I earned a bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from Media Design School. You can view a few of my <a href="#projects">projects</a> here. Feel free to <a href="#contact">get in touch</a>, I'd be happy to chat about job opportunities and projects I've worked on.
